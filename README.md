# null id: Code as Art

**null id** is where art and code intertwine, exploring the beauty of complexity. This repository serves as a public archive of the code used to create generative artwork and interactive installations featured on the [null id blog](https://null-id.com).

Each piece of code is an experiment—a canvas for ideas that navigate the nuanced intersections of technology, creativity, and humanity. Whether it’s a Python-powered generative artwork or an emotional canvas that reacts to user interaction, every creation aims to express the unspoken and unseen: love, ADHD, depression, relationships, work culture, and the chaotic yet beautiful tapestry of life.

# Artworks

Each folder or file in this repository represents a standalone artwork. Detailed descriptions and usage instructions are included as comments in the code or in accompanying `README.md` files within subdirectories.

Notable pieces:
- **Emotion Face**: An artwork visualizing the interplay of joy and depression.
- **Interactive Emotional Canvas**: A responsive canvas reacting to user input.
